This small app (created with create-react-app) displays the same React components using 3 different styling solutions:
- CSS modules, SCSS, and classnames
- emotion (CSS-in-JS)
- styled-components (CSS-in-JS)

You can set it up locally (steps below), but it's simple enough to convey in a screenshot:
